Test whether old-fashioned for loops work with continues

Declare local variables (use LocalVariableTable and LocalVariableTypeTable)

Support try-catch

CleanupStrategy that identifies for-in loops

Taint expressions with types - should be able to distinguish int/long/float/double based on load/store operations
Find how ints are being used - boolean/short/int/char by function definitions?
If boolean is identified, expressions must be revised so as to use true/false instead of 0/1

Decompile Enums

Don't declare unused variables
