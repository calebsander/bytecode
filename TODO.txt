Test whether old-fashioned for loops work with continues

Support Class constant

Declare local variables (use LocalVariableTable and LocalVariableTypeTable)

Support try-catch

Identify +=, |=, etc.; also move the varN++ special case to a CleanupStrategy; special case varN--

CleanupStrategy that identifies for-in loops

Rename "Operation" to "Instruction"

Identify new ...[]{...} expressions, e.g.:
new int[3][0] = 1;
new int[3][1] = 2;
new int[3][2] = 3;
var3 = new int[3];

Support switch(string)

Taint expressions with types - should be able to distinguish int/long/float/double based on load/store operations
Find how ints are being used - boolean/short/int/char by function definitions?
If boolean is identified, expressions must be revised so as to use true/false instead of 0/1
